- npm contains two parts:
  - command line interface app
    - automatically comes included with NodeJS.
  - package repository
    - It has about 800000 package when this lecture recording...
      - This make npm a largest software registry in the world.

- If we want to manage our package with npm, we just need to enter `npm init` in the root directory of the project as shown above.
- The package.json generated by npm init can be found as a description of the project, but in fact the main function is to help us manage the project's packages.
  - We will actually use npm to install the package in a later lecture, and then we will see what happens to the contents of package.json.
