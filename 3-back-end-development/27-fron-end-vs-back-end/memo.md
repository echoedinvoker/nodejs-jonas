- Both the **front-end** and **back-end** are in a **client-server architecture**.

![Alt webpage](pic/bandicam%202022-10-04%2009-50-28-561.jpg)

- The **front end** is everything that happens in the **client browser**.
- So the **front-end job** is about designing and making what the user can see in his **browser**.

![Alt front-end stack](pic/bandicam%202022-10-04%2009-50-32-099.jpg)

- The basic tools used by **front-end** developers are:
  - **HTML**
  - **CSS**
  - **JavaScript**

![Alt other front-end tools](pic/bandicam%202022-10-04%2009-50-35-760.jpg)

- Modern front-end developers have added a lot of stuff to their front-end development stacks:
  - **React**
  - **Angular**
  - **Redux**
  - **GraphQL**
  - etc.
- These tools make front-end web development **easier**.

![Alt back-end](pic/bandicam%202022-10-04%2009-50-43-794.jpg)

- The backend is about everything that happens on the **web server**.
- Everything that is **not visible** to the final user is called a **backend**.

![Alt files](pic/bandicam%202022-10-04%2009-50-53-733.jpg)

- First of all, the back-end is a computer connected to the network, which stores some **files** such as HTML, CSS, pictures, etc.

![Alt HTTP servers](pic/bandicam%202022-10-04%2009-50-57-492.jpg)

- Second, run a HTTP server.
  - it can understand URL, request and deliver response.

- So the back-end actually uses the **HTTP server** software to communicate with the **front-end browser** through **request and response**, which is like a bridge.

![Alt static](pic/bandicam%202022-10-04%2009-51-04-729.jpg)

- Only the back-end of the above architecture is called a **static** server.
  - It simply provides some **static files** to the front end.
  - If you just need to host a simple website, this is what you need.

![Alt app](pic/bandicam%202022-10-04%2009-51-11-405.jpg)

- Adding a **dynamic application** to the back-end architecture will turn it into a **dynamic server**.

![Alt database](pic/bandicam%202022-10-04%2009-51-16-108.jpg)

- Usually when we build a **dynamic server**, we also use a **database**.
- Some common things will be processed on the back end such as:
  - create user profile
  - user log in and out
  - send email
  - process payment
  - **retrieve and send request from a database to a client**
  - **manipulate data in database**
  - **fill up website templates**
  - etc.

![Alt node and mongo](pic/bandicam%202022-10-04%2009-51-26-618.jpg)

- We will use **NodeJS** as our **dynamic web server** and **MongoDB** as our **database**.

![Alt back-end stack](pic/bandicam%202022-10-04%2009-51-32-138.jpg)

- But there are many different combinations on the back end such as:
  - PHP and PostgreSQL
  - Python and MySQL
  - Ruby and Rails
  - etc.

## **Full Stack**

- The **full stack** means that the developer deals with **both** front-end and back-end.
- But full-stack developers have become increasingly rare, because the front-end is becoming more and more complex.
