![Alt follow next concept](pic/01.jpg)

- In the previous lection, we have redirected the '/tours/:tourId/reviews' url in tourRouters.js to reviewsRouters.js as a POST request, but it also works for GET requests with the same url.
  - So we only need to deal with the controller function directly in this lectur.
